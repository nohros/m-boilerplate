## Purpose

`m-boilerplate` is designed to make life easy by providing a basic framework with which to kickstart mithril projects. It contains a best-practice directory structure to ensure code reusability and maximum scalability. m-boilerplate also comes prepackaged with the most popular design frameworks around: [Mithril](http://lhorie.github.io/mithril) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). Lastly, it contains a sophisticated [Gulp](http://gulpjs.cpm) based build system to ensure maximum productivity. All you need to do is clone it and start coding!
